# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository consists of several machine learning algorithms being implemented from scratch using Python and Matlab. Each algorithm is explained breifly below. Most of the datasets are taken from UCI. If data is taken from UCI dataset, then the name is mentioned. Otherwise you can find the dataset in /data folder.

## Primal SVM

 Primal svm is finding the minimum of the following equations. 
                 (1/2) ||w||^2
                 
 We use the following matlab inbuilt quadprog method to solve this quadratic problem. 
 x = quadprog(H,f,A,b);
 
 where 
 x = [w b]
 H = [I 0;0 0]
 A being diagonal(Y) * vector of X alone with last column being vector of ones
 b is vector of 1

 ## Decision Tree -- Information Gain Based
 
 Atrribute split for decision tree is based on the Information Gain for the attributes. Higher the information gain less uncertainity about Y given X. Following image shows the formula for entropy calculation in IG.

 ## Using PCA for Feature Selection 
 If we performed PCA directly on the training data, we would generate new features that are linear combinations of our original features. If instead, we wanted to find a subset of our current features that were good for classification, we could still use PCA, but we would need to be more clever about it. The primary idea in this approach is to select features from the data that are good at explaining as much of the variance as possible. To do this, we can use the results of PCA as a guide. 

Algorithm for a given k and s is explained by the following image:

 ## Constructing a Bayesian Network Model 
 To construct a Bayesian Network model, we need to construct Info Gain Matrix for each edges and pass through a model which finds the maximum spanning tree. We have used matlab inbuit method to construct maximum spanning tree.

### Dataset

 ## Using EM algorithm to learn parameters for a Bayesian Network with missing entries
 We are using the previously constructed bayesian network for this problem, We pass the edges and learn the parameters. First we construct all possible data points if an entry has missing values. Now we find the best point which gives us the maximum probability. We update thethas at the end of a single iteration over entire data set. Den we compare the prev prob of the entire iteration. If it is less than the threshold (converged) we stop. 
 
Algorithm for EM algorithm is shown below:
